After months of hard work from the team, we are proud to announce the release of `obsidian` version 0.2. This release included a lot of features to improve `obsidian`'s developer experience. This blog post covers the highlights of the release.

`obsidian` is a Rust async http framework for reliable and efficient web.

## New Logo!

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';
export const Logo = () => (
  <figure>
    <img width="550" src={useBaseUrl("img/obsidian.svg")} alt="Screenshot of Obsidian logo" />
  </figure>
)

<Logo />

We now have a logo!

## Async/Await Support
Rust 1.39.0 introduced `async`/`.await` syntax, which can be used to write asynchronous funtion in synchronous way. It also makes the codes more straight forward. In `obsidian`, we treat the developer experience as on of the top priority goal. Thus, migration to async/await enabled structure is definitely needed.

```rust
async fn get_user(mut ctx: Context) -> ContextResult {
    #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
    struct User {
        name: String,
        age: i8,
    }

    let user: User = ctx.json().await?;

    ctx.build_json(user).ok()
}
```

## Application State

Application state is shared with all the routes. It can be accessed by handlers and middlewares. You can inject your database connection in to application state.

```rust
use obsidian::{context::Context, App, ObsidianError};

#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct AppState {
    pub db_connection_string: String,
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let mut app: App<AppState> = App::new();
    let addr = ([127, 0, 0, 1], 3000).into();

    app.set_app_state(AppState {
        db_connection_string: "localhost:1433".to_string()
    });

    app.get("/", |ctx: Context| async {
        let app_state = ctx.get::<AppState>().ok_or(ObsidianError::NoneError)?;
        let res = Some(format!("connection string: {}", &app_state.db_connection_string));

        ctx.build(res).ok()
    });

    app.listen(&addr, || {
        println!("server is listening to {}", &addr);
    })
    .await;
}
```

## Dynamic Context data
Dynamic context data is just like application state, but within context scope. For example, it can be used to pass data between middlewares and handlers.

```rust
async fn get_profile(ctx: Context) -> ContextResult {
    let current_user = ctx
        .extensions()
        .get::<User>()
        .ok_or(ObsidianError::NoneError)?;

    ctx.build_json(current_user).ok()
}
```

## Response Header
You now can return a response with headers. And did I mention custom headers is supported as well?  

```rust
async fn get_point(ctx: Context) -> ContextResult {
    let point = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };

    ctx.build_json(point)
          .with_header(header::AUTHORIZATION, "token")
          .with_header_str("X-Custom-Header", "Custom header value")
          .ok()
}
```

## Other improvements
- **New Response Syntax**: To solve the lifetime issue with `context`
- **Bugs fixed on the Responder**
- **Apply `clippy` to the source code**

## What is next?
As we mentioned, developer experience and productivity are always our top priority in `obsidian`. The framework is still new and needed a lot of improvements. We always have the convesation on improving those confusing API and syntax noise. We also want to explore more the possibility of the type system, hopefully most of the errors will be captured on compile time.

There are some API redesign will be introduced on the next version to improve developer experience. And then we are planning to provide generator to generate new `obsidian` project. We don't have final a decision yet, it could be just a boilerplate like [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/) but for backend, or something like [`rails`](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [`phoenix`](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) with **convention over configuration** DNA to ease developer's jobs. This will include database connection config by default because we found that setting up database connection everytime for a new project is quite annoying. We want to let our users focus on the important stuffs without sweating the small things.

According to [Rust 2019 survey](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/04/17/Rust-survey-2019.html), productivity is still an important goal for their work. Most of the developers in the survey, with Rust or without Rust, are working on backend application. Therefore we think we are on the right track. We want to build a framework focus on developer experience and productivity and more importantly, we will enjoy using it everyday.
